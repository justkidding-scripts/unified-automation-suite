## üìä Performance Optimization

### Intelligent Rate Control
The suite implements advanced algorithms for optimal performance:

- **Adaptive Backoff**: Automatically adjusts timing based on response patterns
- **Jitter Prevention**: Eliminates thundering herd effects
- **FloodWait Handling**: Intelligent response to rate limiting
- **Success Rate Monitoring**: Continuous performance optimization

### Traffic Patterns
Choose from professionally designed traffic patterns:

1. **Human Browsing** (3-10 requests, natural pauses, reading time)
2. **Burst Activity** (15-50 requests, quiet periods)
3. **Background Sync** (30-second intervals with jitter)
4. **Mobile App** (foreground sessions, background activity)
5. **API Polling** (regular intervals with error backoff)
